# Breadcrumb Plugin

The Breadcrumb Plugin is an HST component, providing the structure of your site based on a menu and also on the 
repository structure.

# Documentation 

Documentation is available at [onehippo-forge.github.io/breadcrumb](https://onehippo-forge.github.io/breadcrumb)

The documentation is generated by this command:

 > mvn clean site:site -Pgithub.pages 
 
The output is in the ```/docs``` directory; push it and GitHub Pages will serve the site automatically. 

For rendering documentation on non-master branches, use the normal site command so the output will be in the ```/target``` 
and therefore ignored by Git.

 > mvn clean site:site
